        The fly lines used in this study are derived from a homozygous wild type
        line, denoted by \textit{+/+;+/+} or $F_0$ and a double balancer line
        (\textit{w;If/CyO;Sb/TM3,Ser}). After a first cross adult flies are
        selected for markers of both balancer chromosomes, yielding an $F_1$
        generation (a.k.a. double balancer cross). A backcross with the initial
        wild type line generates a pool of four different genotypes ($N_1$)
        of which on average 25\% of both chromosome 2 and 3 are balancer
        chromosomes.}

\section{Mutational landscape of balanced chromosomes}

\acreset{snv}
\subsection{\Acp{snv}}
I used whole genome sequencing data of both $F_0$ and $F_1$ cross
simulataneously to call \acp{snv}. The comparison of genotypes of the homozygous
wild type line and the heterozygous cross enabled me to assign mutations to
individual haplotypes: if, for example, a \snv was called heterozygous in the
cross and homozygous alternative in the wild type sample, the variant is located
on the wild type chromosome and not on the homologous balancer chromosome.

Of the 761,348 detected \acp{snv} on \ac{chr2} and \ac{chr3}, 38.9\% can be
assigned to the balancer chromosomes, 29.5\% to the wild type chromosomes and
29.8\% are shared between both. Only a fraction of 1.8\% of \acp{snv} did not
fit the expected genotypes, which can mostly be attributed to regions in the
wild type chromosomes not being fully homozygous.
On average every 210bp there is a \snv distinguishing balancer and wild type
haplotypes.

\end{table}

The number of balancer-specific \acp{snv} is around 1.3 times higher than wild
type-specific ones. Moreover, when I compared our fly lines to the Drosophila
reference panel (DGRP) \citep{Mackay2012,Huang2014}, a panel of fully sequenced
inbred \species{D. melanogaster} lines derived from a natural population, I
found that a striking majority of \acp{snv} is represented in the panel, yet
balancer-specific \acp{snv} to a lower fraction (86.1\%) than wild type-specific
ones (92.1\%). These observations are not surprising since balancer chromosomes,
due to their inability to undergo recombination, accumulate and likely tolerate
more mutations over time than normal chromosomes.

I was also interested in the distribution of base substitutions, i.e.
the \explain{mutation spectrum}{as a summary of the total set of
mutations I count the relative frequencies of different base substitutions
(e.g. \texttt{C>T}) and their trinucleotide contexts (one base up- and
downstream). The spectrum of somatic \acp{snv} is often analysed in cancer
genomics in this way, in order to extract \emph{mutational signatures} that are
linked to mutagenic processes}. The idea behind this is that
balancer chromosomes had been derived by X-ray mutagenesis and that this
could have led to a different distribution of base substitutions. However, after
removing \acp{snv} shared with the DGRP we did not observe any striking
differences in the \snv signatures between wild type and balancers (see
\cref{fig:signatures}).

    which was predicted based on paired-end read signature using \delly.
    The additional signals
    included for a visual validation are (1) a mappability track (fraction
    of uniquely mappable reads), (2) the bi-allelic frequency (fraction of
    reads supporting the alternative allele of an \snv), and (3)
    the total read coverage (as genomic coverage, in 100bp windows). Bi-allelic
    frequency is typically the clearest signal to discriminate true from false
    copy number variants, but it reuqires the presence of \acp{snv}. Note }

    Haplotype-resolved Hi-C contact frequency maps of chromosomes 2 and 3 in
    respect to the wild type reference genome are shown (A). Details of the data
    processing can be found in \cref{sec:suppl_hic}. The bottom triangles show
    characteristic ``bowtie-shaped'' patterns as well as gaps on the diagonal
    that demarcate breakpoint junctions of the rearranged balancer chromosomes.
    The respective sections of the reference genome are color-coded, with a grey
    circle representing centromers.
    These junctions can be followed to reconstruct the relative order of the
    balancer chromosomes such as shown in the top panel (B). Vertical ``bowties''
    represent a connection of segments in same orientation where as horizontal
    ones mark junction of segments that are inverted in respect to one another.
    The fully reconstructed order of the balancer genomes is shown in the bottom
    panel (C). This matches previous annotation from karyotyping\footnotemark.}

    based on the characteristic biallelic frequency signal and is validated by
    a total increase of locus-internal Hi-C contacts on the balancer chromosome,
    as seen as the red triangle. Moreover, a decrease in balancer-specific
    contacts close to the diagonal left of the locus (blue) as
    well as an increase left of the upper tip of the triangular region
