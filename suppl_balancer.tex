\chapter{Supplementary information to \texorpdfstring{\cref{sec:balancer}}{the balancer project}}
\label{sec:suppl_balancer}

The content of this supplementary chapter is largly taken from the supplementary
methods in \textbf{our paper}\todo{cite our paper} and partly adapted when
neccessary.

\section{SNV calling}
\label{sec:suppl_snv}

Both \wgs and mate pair sequencing data was mapped to
\ac{dm6} using \bwamem version 0.7.15. \Ac{snv} and short indel calling was
performed using \freebayes version v0.9.21-19 with disabled population priors on
the \wgs data of both $F_0$ and $F_1$ samples simultaneously. The results were
filtered using \vcflib based on a quality value of at least 30,
a minimum of at least two reads carrying the allele to the right and to the left
end, and on the fact that the allele was seen on at least two reads mapping in
each direction. We further normalized variants, removed mutli-allelic variants,
and decomposed multi-nucleotide substitutions (which are reported as haplotype
blocks by \freebayes) into \acp{snv} using \vt (the sub-command \textsc{decompose\_blocksub}
was used for decomposition). We finally remove contigs other than chromosome 2,
3, and X and obtained a total of 860,095 \acp{snv} and small indels.



\section{Mutational signature analysis}
\label{sec:suppl_mutsign}

Starting from the set of 520,521 balancer- or wild type-specific \acp{snv},
I removed the ones which are present in the DGRP freeze 2.0 \snv call set.
Then I used the R package \textsc{SomaticSignatures} \citep{Gehring2015} to
count base substitutions and their contexts of the remaining 58,457 variants
and plotted their relative frequencies in \cref{fig:signatures}. The absence
of striking differences between balancer and wild type spectra demotivated me
from deeper investigations of mutational signatures.
