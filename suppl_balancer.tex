\section{Mutational signature analysis}
\label{sec:suppl_mutsign}

Starting from the set of 520,521 balancer- or wild type-specific \acp{snv},
I removed the ones which are present in the DGRP freeze 2.0 \snv call set.
Then I used the R package \textsc{SomaticSignatures} \citep{Gehring2015} to
count base substitutions and their contexts of the remaining 58,457 variants
and plotted their relative frequencies in \cref{fig:signatures}. The absence
of striking differences between balancer and wild type spectra demotivated me
from deeper investigations of mutational signatures.

        removed, leaving 58,457 variants.}
