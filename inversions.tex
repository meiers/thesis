In the motivation to this chapter I mention Adrian's \explain{Four-primer
strategy}{\marginfig{four_primer_strategy.pdf} Four separate PCRs are run using
primer pairs FR, fr, Ff and Rr.
In samples not carrying the inversion only FR and fr will yield bands, in
homozygous carriers only Ff and Rr, and in heterozygous carriers all four
reactions will yield bands.} and I explain it quickly in the margin.

    {Complex inversion types revealed by PacBio and ONT MinION reads}
    {Examplatory loci were selected to represent the most most commonly seen
    classes of complex inverted variants (listed in table XXX).
    Green lines denote inversions predicted by \delly. PacBio circular
    consesus sequences and raw ONT MinION reads are compared to their reference
    locus via dotplots using maximal unique matches (REF) of
    lengths at least 10 (PacBio) or 8 (MinION). Axes denote sequence lengths in
    base pairs. Original read names are included for later reference.}

    plotted the same way as in \cref{fig:complex_invs}.}
