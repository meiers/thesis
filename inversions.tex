\chapter{Complex inversions in the human genome}
\label{sec:inversions}

See suppl. info in \cref{sec:suppl_inversions}.

In the motivation to this chapter I mention Adrian's \explain{Four-primer
strategy}{\marginfig{four_primer_strategy.pdf} Four separate PCRs are run using
primer pairs FR, fr, Ff and Rr.
In samples not carrying the inversion only FR and fr will yield bands, in
homozygous carriers only Ff and Rr, and in heterozygous carriers all four
reactions will yield bands.} and I explain it quickly in the margin.

% QUOTE FROM Sudmant et al, 2015:
% To further explore inversion sequence complexity, we performed a battery of
% targeted analyses, leveraging PacBio resequencing of fos- mids (targeting 34
% loci), sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Minion (60 loci) and PacBio (206 loci)
% of long-range PCR amplicons, and data for 13 loci from another sample (CHM1)
% sequenced by high- coverage PacBio WGS14. Altogether we verified and further
% characterized 229 inversion sites, 208 using long-read data and 21 by PCR
% (Supplementary Table 15), increasing the number of known validated inversions
% by .2.5-fold.

    {Complex inversion types revealed by PacBio and ONT MinION reads}
    {Examplatory loci were selected to represent the most most commonly seen
    classes of complex inverted variants (listed in table XXX).
    Green lines denote inversions predicted by \delly. PacBio circular
    consesus sequences and raw ONT MinION reads are compared to their reference
    locus via dotplots using maximal unique matches (REF) of
    lengths at least 10 (PacBio) or 8 (MinION). Axes denote sequence lengths in
    base pairs. Original read names are included for later reference.}

    any of three technologies. Quality is approximated by number of mismatches

    Note that unlike Illumina-assembled reads, PacBio assemblies are restricted
    to the size of the amplicons.}

    {Sizes were determined from assembled loci using \acs{last}-split as

    limited, which potentially explains shorter sizes for the rearranged part in
    loci with higher complexity.}

    assembly, vertically, vs. its reference locus, horizontally) and highlights
    sequence alignments (red). On the right, the sequence alignment around the

    blunt ends or micro-homology.}
