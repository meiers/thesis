\chapter{Introduction}


I can use the \margintext{\textbf{margin} is the space left and right of the 
main text} margin on the side to define a word in the text or to add comments to
my own text. I also want the TODO command to put notes on the margin. What I
like about the marginnote package is that it always puts text on the outer
margin.

These are examples for the usage of abbreviations such as \acp{sv}. An \sv can also
be written using the short-cut macro \textsc{\\sv}
