\section{Terminology around genetic variation}
\label{sec:variation}

Alteration in the DNA of an organism, or of a cell, can arise spontaneously via
chemical or biological processes. If not repaired faithfully, they leave
\emph{variants} (or \emph{mutations}) of the nucleotide sequence. Some variants
only affect a single nucleotide in the double-stranded DNA---these variants are
referred to as \emph{\acfp{snv}}. Others, termed \emph{\acf{sv}}
(introduced in \cref{sec:sv}), affect larger portions of DNA and are the
central topic of the research presented here.

Most metazoan organisms are diploid, which means they contain two non-identical
copies of each chromosome: one of maternal and one of paternal origin. Any new
variant (within a cell or organism) typically arises only on one of the two
homologous chromosomes. Such a variant is said to be \emph{heterozygous}. The
genomic locus harboring this variant exists in two different versions, which we
call \emph{alleles}. Specifically it harbors a \emph{reference allele}, which is
in agreement with the average individual encoded in the reference assembly, and
an \emph{alternative allele} that describes the non-reference variant form. A
site with exactly two alleles seen across a population is termed
\emph{bi-allelic}, but there are also sites that contain multiple different
alleles and are thus \emph{multi-allelic}. Chromosomes can contain many variants
and depending on the detection strategies, it is often unclear which variants
reside on the same homologue. If this is known, we refer to the ensemble of
variants present along a single homologue as a haploid genotype, or short
\emph{haplotype}. Alleles that are present in the germ line, i.e. the cells
carrying inheritable genetic material, can be propagated to offspring. This way,
an individual can end up carrying the same variant of a genomic locus on both
homologues, which makes it a \emph{homozygous} variant. Variants that are seen
more often in a population, specifically in at least 1\% of the homologoues,
are also called \emph{polymorphisms}.

When a variant is present in an individual, but not in their parents, we call it
a \emph{de novo} mutation. The variant could either have occurred within the
zygote during the first few cell divisions, or already beforehand in the
parental germ line. The latter can sometimes be inferred if other offspring of
those parents carries the same variant. Variants that occur not in the germ line
but in cells of the non-inheritable part of an organism are \emph{somatic}
variants. When an affected cell undergoes repeated divisions, a somatic variant
can be present in a relevant fraction of the total cells of an individual---this
is called \emph{somatic mosaicism}. Depending on how early in development the
variant occurred and on natural selection it can be present in all cells of the
same lineage \citep{Youssoufian2002}. Somatic variants are also the underlying
mechanism of cancer \citep{Campbell2007}.
